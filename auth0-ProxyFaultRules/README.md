# auth0-ProxyFaultRules
This is a shared flow and you should read our [documentation](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/shared-flows) to understand more about it.

This shared flow encapsulates the fault rules into a single reusable flow.  

It is included in the `auth0-oauth` and `auth0-oauth-store-jwt` proxies.  This shared flow must be deployed first. Please read the main README to understand how to do this.
